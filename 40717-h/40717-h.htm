        Four bells were struck, the watch was called on deck,

      <div class="line">
        All work aboard was over for the hour,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And some men sang and others played at check,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or mended clothes or watched the sunset glower.

      <div class="line">
        The bursting west was like an opening flower,

        And one man watched it till the light was dim,

        He was the painter in that swift ship's crew,

        Lampman and painter--tall, a slight-built man,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Young for his years, and not yet twenty-two;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sickly, and not yet brown with the sea's tan.

        "Being neither man nor seaman by his tally,"

        His work began at five; he worked all day,

      <div class="line">
        Keeping no watch and having all night in.

      <div class="line">
        His work was what the mate might care to say;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He mixed red lead in many a bouilli tin;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His dungarees were smeared with paraffin.

      <div class="line">
        "Go drown himself" his round-house mates advised him,

        And all hands called him "Dauber" and despised him.

        Si, the apprentice, stood beside the spar,

      <div class="line">
        Stripped to the waist, a basin at his side,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slushing his hands to get away the tar,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And then he washed himself and rinsed and dried;

      <div class="line">
        Towelling his face, hair-towzelled, eager eyed,
      </div>

        He crossed the spar to Dauber, and there stood
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Watching the gold of heaven turn to blood.

        Tore on out of the tropics, straining her sheets,

      <div class="line">
        Whitening her trackway to a milky strip,

        Dim with green bubbles and twisted water meets,

        Her clacking tackle tugged at pins and cleats,

        Her great sails bellied stiff, her great masts leaned:
      </div>

        Si talked with Dauber, standing by the side.

      <div class="line">
        "Why did you come to sea, painter?" he said.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "I want to be a painter," he replied,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "And know the sea and ships from A to Z,
      </div>

        And paint great ships at sea before I'm dead;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Ships under skysails running down the Trade--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Ships and the sea; there's nothing finer made.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "But there's so much to learn, with sails and ropes,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And how the sails look, full or being furled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And how the lights change in the troughs and slopes,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the sea's colours up and down the world,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And how a storm looks when the sprays are hurled

      <div class="line">
        At the roll's end, the checking in the sway--

        I want to paint them perfect, short of the noise;

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The fo'c'sles with the men there, dripping wet:

        Down sank the crimson sun into the sea,

        The wind cut chill at once, the west grew dun.

        Darker it grew, still darker, and the stars

      <div class="line">
        Burned golden, and the fiery fishes came.

      <div class="line">
        The wire-note loudened from the straining spars;

      <div class="line">
        The sheet-blocks clacked together always the same;

      <div class="line">
        The rushing fishes streaked the seas with flame,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Racing the one speed noble as their own:

      <div class="line">

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Just by the round-house door, as it grew dark,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Boatswain caught the Dauber with, "Now, you;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Till now I've spared you, damn you! now you hark:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I've just had hell for what you didn't do;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I'll have you broke and sent among the crew
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        If you get me more trouble by a particle.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Don't you forget, you daubing, useless article!

        "You thing, you twice-laid thing from Port Mahon!"

        Then came the Cook's "Is that the Dauber there?

      <div class="line">
        Why don't you leave them stinking paints alone?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They stink the house out, poisoning all the air.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Just take them out." "Where to?" "I don't care where.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I won't have stinking paint here." From their plates:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "That's right; wet paint breeds fever," growled his mates.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        He took his still wet drawings from the berth

      <div class="line">
        And climbed the ladder to the deck-house top;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Beneath, the noisy half-deck rang with mirth,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        For two ship's boys were putting on the strop:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        One, clambering up to let the skylight drop,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Saw him bend down beneath a boat and lay
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His drawings there, till all were hid away,
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And stand there silent, leaning on the boat,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Watching the constellations rise and burn,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Until the beauty took him by the throat,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So stately is their glittering overturn;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Armies of marching eyes, armies that yearn
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With banners rising and falling, and passing by
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Over the empty silence of the sky.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber sighed there looking at the sails,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Wind-steadied arches leaning on the night,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The high trucks traced on heaven and left no trails;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The moonlight made the topsails almost white,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The passing sidelight seemed to drip green light.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And on the clipper rushed with fire-bright bows;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He sighed, "I'll never do't," and left the house.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Now," said the reefer, "up! Come, Sam; come, Si,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Dauber's been hiding something." Up they slid,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Treading on naked tiptoe stealthily
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To grope for treasure at the long-boat skid.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Drawings!" said Sam. "Is this what Dauber hid?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Lord! I expected pudding, not this rot.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Still, come, we'll have some fun with what we've got."
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        They smeared the paint with turpentine until
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They could remove with mess-clouts every trace
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of quick perception caught by patient skill,

      <div class="line">
        And lines that had brought blood into his face.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They wiped the pigments off, and did erase,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With knives, all sticking clots. When they had done.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Under the boat they laid them every one.

        All he had drawn since first he came to sea,

      <div class="line">
        They chuckled then to think how mad he'd be
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Finding his paintings vanished into air.

      <div class="line">
        Eight bells were struck, and feet from everywhere

      <div class="line">
        Went shuffling aft to muster in the dark;

      <div class="line">
        The mate's pipe glowed above, a dim red spark.

        Names in the darkness passed and voices cried;

        Humming his song, and through the open door

        Next day was Sunday, his free painting day,

      <div class="line">
        He rose when called at five, and did array

      <div class="line">
        The round-house gear, and set the kit-bags straight;

      <div class="line">
        Then kneeling down, like housemaid at a grate,

      <div class="line">
        He scrubbed the deck with sand until his knees

      <div class="line">

        Soon all was clean, his Sunday tasks were done;

        His day was clear for painting as he chose.

        The wetted decks were drying in the sun,

        The men coiled up, or swabbed, or sought repose.

        The drifts of silver arrows fell and rose

      <div class="line">
        As flying fish took wing; the breakfast passed,

      <div class="line">
        Wasting good time, but he was free at last.

      <div class="line">
        Free for two hours and more to tingle deep,

        Catching a likeness in a line or tint,

      <div class="line">
        Wind-wrinkled at the clews, and white like lint,

      <div class="line">
        The glittering of the blue waves into glint;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Free to attempt it all, the proud ship's pawings,

      <div class="line">
        The sea, the sky--he went to fetch his drawings.

        Up to the deck-house top he quickly climbed,

      <div class="line">
        He stooped to find them underneath the boat.

      <div class="line">
        He found them all obliterated, slimed,

      <div class="line">
        Blotted, erased, gone from him line and note.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They were all spoiled: a lump came in his throat,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Being vain of his attempts, and tender skinned--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Beneath the skylight watching reefers grinned.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        He clambered down, holding the ruined things.

      <div class="line">
        "Bosun," he called, "look here, did you do these:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Wipe off my paints and cut them into strings,
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        Don't stare, but did you do it? Answer, please."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Bosun turned: "I'll give you a thick ear!

        "I touch your stinking daubs? The Dauber's daft."

      <div class="line">
        A crowd was gathering now to hear the fun;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The reefers tumbled out, the men laid aft,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Cook blinked, cleaning a mess kid in the sun.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "What's up with Dauber now?" said everyone.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Someone has spoiled my drawings--look at this!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Well, that's a dirty trick, by God, it is!"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "It is," said Sam, "a low-down dirty trick,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To spoil a fellow's work in such a way,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And if you catch him, Dauber, punch him sick,
      </div>

        For he deserves it, be he who he may."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A seaman shook his old head wise and grey.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "It seems to me," he said, "who ain't no judge,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Them drawings look much better now they're smudge."
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Where were they, Dauber? On the deck-house? Where?"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Under the long-boat, in a secret place."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "The blackguard must have seen you put them there.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He is a swine! I tell him to his face:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I didn't think we'd anyone so base."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Nor I," said Dauber. "There was six weeks' time
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Just wasted in these drawings: it's a crime!"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Well, don't you say we did it," growled his mates,

      <div class="line">
        "And as for crime, be damned! the things were smears--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Best overboard, like you, with shot for weights;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Thank God they're gone, and now go shake your ears."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber listened, very near to tears.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Dauber, if I were you," said Sam again,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "I'd aft, and see the Captain and complain."
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="line">
        A sigh came from the assembled seamen there.

      <div class="line">
        Would he be such a fool for their delight
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As go to tell the Captain? Would he dare?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And would the thunder roar, the lightning smite?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        There was the Captain come to take a sight,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Handling his sextant by the chart-house aft.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber turned, the seamen thought him daft.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The Captain took his sights--a mate below

      <div class="line">
        Noted the times; they shouted to each other,

      <div class="line">
        The Captain quick with "Stop," the answer slow,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Repeating slowly one height then another.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The swooping clipper stumbled through the smother,

      <div class="line">
        The ladder brasses in the sunlight burned,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber waited till the Captain turned.

    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">

        There stood the Dauber, humbled to the bone,

      <div class="line">
        Waiting to speak. The Captain let him wait,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Glanced at the course, and called in even tone,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "What is the man there wanting, Mr. Mate?"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The logship clattered on the grating straight,

        Too often, and too fiercely, not to know

        That this, and so much like it, of man's toil,

        Compassed by naked manhood in strange places,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Was all heroic, but outside the coil

      <div class="line">
        Within which modern art gleams or grimaces;

      <div class="line">
        That if he drew that line of sailor's faces

        Sweating the sail, their passionate play and change,
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        High on an unseen stage, shaking and reeling;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And men through him would understand their feeling,

      <div class="line">
        Their might, their misery, their tragic power,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And all by suffering pain a little hour;

      <div class="line">
        High on the yard with them, feeling their pain,

      <div class="line">
        The fog, come closelier down, no answer made.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Denser it grew, until the ship was lost.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The elemental hid her; she was merged
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In mufflings of dark death, like a man's ghost,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        New to the change of death, yet thither urged.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then from the hidden waters something surged--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mournful, despairing, great, greater than speech,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A noise like one slow wave on a still beach.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Mournful, and then again mournful, and still
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of the night that mighty voice arose;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber at his foghorn felt the thrill.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Who rode that desolate sea? What forms were those?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mournful, from things defeated, in the throes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of memory of some conquered hunting-ground,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of the night of death arose the sound.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Whales!" said the Mate. They stayed there all night long
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Answering the horn. Out of the night they spoke,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Defeated creatures who had suffered wrong,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But were still noble underneath the stroke.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They filled the darkness when the Dauber woke;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The men came peering to the rail to hear,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the sea sighed, and the fog rose up sheer.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        A wall of nothing at the world's last edge,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where no life came except defeated life.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber felt shut in within a hedge,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Behind which form was hidden and thought was rife,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And that a blinding flash, a thrust, a knife
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Would sweep the hedge away and make all plain,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Brilliant beyond all words, blinding the brain.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        So the night passed, but then no morning broke--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Only a something showed that night was dead.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A sea-bird, cackling like a devil, spoke,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the fog drew away and hung like lead.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Like mighty cliffs it shaped, sullen and red;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Like glowering gods at watch it did appear,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And sometimes drew away, and then drew near.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Like islands, and like chasms, and like hell,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But always mighty and red, gloomy and ruddy,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Shutting the visible sea in like a well;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slow heaving in vast ripples, blank and muddy,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where the sun should have risen it streaked bloody.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The day was still-born; all the sea-fowl scattering
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Splashed the still water, mewing, hovering, clattering.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Then Polar snow came down little and light,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Till all the sky was hidden by the small,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Most multitudinous drift of dirty white
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Tumbling and wavering down and covering all--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Covering the sky, the sea, the clipper tall,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Furring the ropes with white, casing the mast,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Coming on no known air, but blowing past.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And all the air seemed full of gradual moan,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As though in those cloud-chasms the horns were blowing
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The mort for gods cast out and overthrown,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or for the eyeless sun plucked out and going.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slow the low gradual moan came in the snowing;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber felt the prelude had begun.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The snowstorm fluttered by; he saw the sun
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Show and pass by, gleam from one towering prison
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into another, vaster and more grim,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Which in dull crags of darkness had arisen
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To muffle-to a final door on him.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The gods upon the dull crags lowered dim,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The pigeons chattered, quarrelling in the track.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In the south-west the dimness dulled to black.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Then came the cry of "Call all hands on deck!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber knew its meaning; it was come:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Cape Horn, that tramples beauty into wreck,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And crumples steel and smites the strong man dumb.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Down clattered flying kites and staysails: some
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sang out in quick, high calls: the fair-leads skirled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And from the south-west came the end of the world.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Caught in her ball-dress," said the Bosun, hauling
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Lee-ay, lee-ay!" quick, high, came the men's call;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        It was all wallop of sails and startled calling.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Let fly!" "Let go!" "Clew up!" and "Let go all!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Now up and make them fast!" "Here, give us a haul!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Now up and stow them! Quick! By God! we're done!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The blackness crunched all memory of the sun.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Up!" said the Mate. "Mizen top-gallants. Hurry!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber ran, the others ran, the sails
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slatted and shook; out of the black a flurry
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Whirled in fine lines, tattering the edge to trails.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Painting and art and England were old tales
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Told in some other life to that pale man,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Who struggled with white fear and gulped and ran.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        He struck a ringbolt in his haste and fell--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rose, sick with pain, half-lamed in his left knee;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He reached the shrouds where clambering men pell-mell
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Hustled each other up and cursed him; he
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Hurried aloft with them: then from the sea
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Came a cold, sudden breath that made the hair
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Stiff on the neck, as though Death whispered there.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        A man below him punched him in the side.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Get up, you Dauber, or let me get past."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He saw the belly of the skysail skied,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Gulped, and clutched tight, and tried to go more fast.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sometimes he missed his ratline and was grassed,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Scraped his shin raw against the rigid line.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The clamberers reached the futtock-shrouds' incline.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Cursing they came; one, kicking out behind,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Kicked Dauber in the mouth, and one below
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Punched at his calves; the futtock-shrouds inclined
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        It was a perilous path for one to go.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Up, Dauber, up!" A curse followed a blow.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He reached the top and gasped, then on, then on.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And one voice yelled "Let go!" and one "All gone!"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Fierce clamberers, some in oilskins, some in rags,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Hustling and hurrying up, up the steep stairs.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Before the windless sails were blown to flags,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And whirled like dirty birds athwart great airs,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Ten men in all, to get this mast of theirs
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Snugged to the gale in time. "Up! Damn you, run!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The mizen topmast head was safely won.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Lay out!" the Bosun yelled. The Dauber laid
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out on the yard, gripping the yard, and feeling
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sick at the mighty space of air displayed
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Below his feet, where mewing birds were wheeling.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A giddy fear was on him; he was reeling.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He bit his lip half through, clutching the jack.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A cold sweat glued the shirt upon his back.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The yard was shaking, for a brace was loose.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He felt that he would fall; he clutched, he bent,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clammy with natural terror to the shoes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        While idiotic promptings came and went.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Snow fluttered on a wind-flaw and was spent;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He saw the water darken. Someone yelled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Frap it; don't stay to furl! Hold on!" He held.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Darkness came down--half darkness--in a whirl;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The sky went out, the waters disappeared.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He felt a shocking pressure of blowing hurl
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The ship upon her side. The darkness speared
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        At her with wind; she staggered, she careered,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then down she lay. The Dauber felt her go;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He saw his yard tilt downwards. Then the snow
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Whirled all about--dense, multitudinous, cold--

      <div class="line">
        Mixed with the wind's one devilish thrust and shriek,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Which whiffled out men's tears, deafened, took hold,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Flattening the flying drift against the cheek.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The yards buckled and bent, man could not speak.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The ship lay on her broadside; the wind's sound
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Had devilish malice at having got her downed.

        He caught one giddy glimpsing of the deck
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Filled with white water, as though heaped with snow.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He saw the streamers of the rigging blow
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Straight out like pennons from the splintered mast,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then, all sense dimmed, all was an icy blast

      <div class="line">
        Roaring from nether hell and filled with ice,

        Roaring and crashing on the jerking stage,

      <div class="line">
        An utter bridle given to utter vice,

      <div class="line">
        Limitless power mad with endless rage
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Withering the soul; a minute seemed an age.

      <div class="line">
        He clutched and hacked at ropes, at rags of sail,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Thinking that comfort was a fairy-tale

        Told long ago--long, long ago--long since

      <div class="line">
        Comfort and warmth and ease no longer seemed

      <div class="line">
        Things that a man could know: soul, body, brain,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Knew nothing but the wind, the cold, the pain.

        "Leave that!" the Bosun shouted; "Crojick save!"

        The splitting crojick, not yet gone to rags,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Thundered below, beating till something gave,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Bellying between its buntlines into bags.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Some birds were blown past, shrieking: dark, like shags,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Their backs seemed, looking down. "Leu, leu!" they cried.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The ship lay, the seas thumped her; she had died.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">

        They reached the crojick yard, which buckled, buckled

      <div class="line">
        Like a thin whalebone to the topsail's strain.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They laid upon the yard and heaved and knuckled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Pounding the sail, which jangled and leapt again.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        It was quite hard with ice, its rope like chain,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Its strength like seven devils; it shook the mast.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They cursed and toiled and froze: a long time passed.
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        Two hours passed, then a dim lightening came.

        Those frozen ones upon the yard could see

      <div class="line">
        The mainsail and the foresail still the same,

      <div class="line">
        Still battling with the hands and blowing free,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rags tattered where the staysails used to be.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The lower topsails stood; the ship's lee deck
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Seethed with four feet of water filled with wreck.

      <div class="line">
        An hour more went by; the Dauber lost

      <div class="line">
        All sense of hands and feet, all sense of all
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But of a wind that cut him to the ghost,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And of a frozen fold he had to haul,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of heavens that fell and never ceased to fall,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And ran in smoky snatches along the sea,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Leaping from crest to wave-crest, yelling. He
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Lost sense of time; no bells went, but he felt

      <div class="line">
        Ages go over him. At last, at last
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They frapped the cringled crojick's icy pelt;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In frozen bulge and bunt they made it fast.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then, scarcely live, they laid in to the mast.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Captain's speaking trumpet gave a blare,
      </div>
      <div class="line">

        Up to the topsail yard to spend an hour

      <div class="line">
        Stowing a topsail in a blinding snow,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Which made the strongest man among them cower.

      <div class="line">
        More men came up, the fresh hands gave them power,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They stowed the sail; then with a rattle of chain
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        One half the crojick burst its bonds again.

      <div class="line">
        Leaving no surface for the wind, no fold,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then down the weather shrouds, half dead, they grope;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That struggle with the sail had made them old.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They wondered if the crojick furl would hold.

      <div class="line">
        "Lucky," said one, "it didn't spring the spar."
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Now fish those wash-deck buckets out of the slop.

        Here's Dauber says he doesn't like Cape Stiff.
      </div>

        This isn't wind, man, this is only a whiff.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Hold on, all hands, hold on!" a sea, half seen,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Paused, mounted, burst, and filled the main-deck green.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber felt a mountain of water fall.

      <div class="line">
        It covered him deep, deep, he felt it fill,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Over his head, the deck, the fife-rails, all,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Quieting the ship, she trembled and lay still.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then with a rush and shatter and clanging shrill
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Over she went; he saw the water cream
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Over the bitts; he saw the half-deck stream.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Then in the rush he swirled, over she went;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Her lee-rail dipped, he struck, and something gave;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His legs went through a port as the roll spent;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        She paused, then rolled, and back the water drave.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He drifted with it as a part of the wave,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Drowning, half-stunned, exhausted, partly frozen,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He struck the booby hatchway; then the Bosun
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Leaped, seeing his chance, before the next sea burst,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And caught him as he drifted, seized him, held,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Up-ended him against the bitts, and cursed.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "This ain't the George's Swimming Baths," he yelled;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Keep on your feet!" Another grey-back felled
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The two together, and the Bose, half-blind,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Spat: "One's a joke," he cursed, "but two's unkind."

    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Now, damn it, Dauber!" said the Mate. "Look out,

      <div class="line">
        Or you'll be over the side!" The water freed;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Each clanging freeing-port became a spout.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The men cleared up the decks as there was need.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The Dauber's head was cut, he felt it bleed
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into his oilskins as he clutched and coiled.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Water and sky were devils' brews which boiled,

    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Boiled, shrieked, and glowered; but the ship was saved.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Snugged safely down, though fourteen sails were split.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of the dark a fiercer fury raved.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The grey-backs died and mounted, each crest lit
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With a white toppling gleam that hissed from it
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And slid, or leaped, or ran with whirls of cloud,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mad with inhuman life that shrieked aloud.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The watch was called; Dauber might go below.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Splice the main brace!" the Mate called. All laid aft
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To get a gulp of momentary glow
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As some reward for having saved the craft.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The steward ladled mugs, from which each quaff'd
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Whisky, with water, sugar, and lime-juice, hot,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A quarter of a pint each made the tot.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Beside the lamp-room door the steward stood
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Ladling it out, and each man came in turn,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Tipped his sou'-wester, drank it, grunted "Good!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And shambled forward, letting it slowly burn:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        When all were gone the Dauber lagged astern,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Torn by his frozen body's lust for heat,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The liquor's pleasant smell, so warm, so sweet,
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And by a promise long since made at home
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Never to taste strong liquor. Now he knew
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The worth of liquor; now he wanted some.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His frozen body urged him to the brew;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Yet it seemed wrong, an evil thing to do
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To break that promise. "Dauber," said the Mate,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Drink, and turn in, man; why the hell d'ye wait?"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Please, sir, I'm temperance." "Temperance are you, hey?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That's all the more for me! So you're for slops?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I thought you'd had enough slops for today.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Go to your bunk and ease her when she drops.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And--damme, steward! you brew with too much hops!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Stir up the sugar, man!--and tell your girl
      </div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Then the Mate drank the remnants, six men's share,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And ramped into his cabin, where he stripped
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And danced unclad, and was uproarious there.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In waltzes with the cabin cat he tripped,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Singing in tenor clear that he was pipped--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That "he who strove the tempest to disarm,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Must never first embrail the lee yardarm,"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And that his name was Ginger. Dauber crept

      <div class="line">
        Back to the round-house, gripping by the rail.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The wind howled by; the passionate water leapt;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The night was all one roaring with the gale.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then at the door he stopped, uttering a wail;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His hands were perished numb and blue as veins,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He could not turn the knob for both the Spains.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        A hand came shuffling aft, dodging the seas,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Singing "her nut-brown hair" between his teeth;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Taking the ocean's tumult at his ease
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Even when the wash about his thighs did seethe.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        His soul was happy in its happy sheath;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "What, Dauber, won't it open? Fingers cold?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        You'll talk of this time, Dauber, when you're old."
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        He flung the door half open, and a sea
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Washed them both in, over the splashboard, down;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "You' silly, salt miscarriage!" sputtered he.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Dauber, pull out the plug before we drown!

        Where is the plug?" Groping in pitch dark water,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He sang between his teeth "The Farmer's Daughter."

        It was pitch dark within there; at each roll

      <div class="line">
        The chests slid to the slant; the water rushed,

      <div class="line">
        Making full many a clanging tin pan bowl

      <div class="line">
        Into the black below-bunks as it gushed.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The dog-tired men slept through it; they were hushed.

        "Thank you," the Dauber said; the seaman grinned.

        "This is your first foul weather?" "Yes." "I thought

        He went; the lamp-flame smoked; he slammed the door;

        A film of water loitered across the floor.

        The Dauber watched it come and watched it go;

        He had had revelation of the lies

      <div class="line">
        Cloaking the truth men never choose to know;

      <div class="line">
        He could bear witness now and cleanse their eyes.

        He shook with cold; his hands could not undo

        His oilskin buttons, so he shook and sat,

      <div class="line">
        Watching his dirty fingers, dirty blue,

      <div class="line">
        Hearing without the hammering tackle slat,

      <div class="line">
        Within, the drops from dripping clothes went pat,

      <div class="line">
        Running in little patters, gentle, sweet,

      <div class="line">

        His bunk was sopping wet; he clambered in.

        None of his clothes were dry; his fear recurred.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Cramps bunched the muscles underneath his skin.

      <div class="line">
        The great ship rolled until the lamp was blurred.

      <div class="line">
        He took his Bible and tried to read a word;

      <div class="line">
        Trembled at going aloft again, and then

      <div class="line">
        Resolved to fight it out and show it to men.

        Faces recurred, fierce memories of the yard,

        The frozen sail, the savage eyes, the jests,

      <div class="line">
        The oaths of one great seaman, syphilis-scarred,

      <div class="line">
        The tug of leeches jammed beneath their chests,

      <div class="line">
        The buntlines bellying bunts out into breasts.

      <div class="line">
        The deck so desolate-grey, the sky so wild,

        He fell asleep, and slept like a young child.

    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        But not for long; the cold awoke him soon,

        The hot-ache and the skin-cracks and the cramp,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The seas thundering without, the gale's wild tune,

      <div class="line">
        The sopping misery of the blankets damp.

      <div class="line">
        A speaking-trumpet roared; a sea-boot's stamp
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clogged at the door. A man entered to shout:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "All hands on deck! Arouse here! Tumble out!"
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="line">
        The caller raised the lamp; his oilskins clicked
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As the thin ice upon them cracked and fell.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Rouse out!" he said. "This lamp is frozen wick'd.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rouse out!" His accent deepened to a yell.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "We're among ice; it's blowing up like hell.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        We're going to hand both topsails. Time, I guess,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        We're sheeted up. Rouse out! Don't stay to dress!"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "Is it cold on deck?" said Dauber. "Is it cold?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        We're sheeted up, I tell you, inches thick!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The fo'c'sle's like a wedding-cake, I'm told.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Now tumble out, my sons; on deck here, quick!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rouse out, away, and come and climb the stick.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I'm going to call the half-deck. Bosun! Hey!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Both topsails coming in. Heave out! Away!"
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        He went; the Dauber tumbled from his bunk,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clutching the side. He heard the wind go past,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Making the great ship wallow as if drunk.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        There was a shocking tumult up the mast.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "This is the end," he muttered, "come at last!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I've got to go aloft, facing this cold.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I can't. I can't. I'll never keep my hold.

    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        "I cannot face the topsail yard again.

      <div class="line">
        I never guessed what misery it would be."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The cramps and hot-ache made him sick with pain.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The ship stopped suddenly from a devilish sea,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then, with a triumph of wash, a rush of glee,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The door burst in, and in the water rolled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Filling the lower bunks, black, creaming, cold.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        The lamp sucked out. "Wash!" went the water back,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then in again, flooding; the Bosun swore.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "You useless thing! You Dauber! You lee slack!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Get out, you heekapoota! Shut the door!
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        You coo-ilyaira, what are you waiting for?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of my way, you thing--you useless thing!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He slammed the door indignant, clanging the ring.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And then he lit the lamp, drowned to the waist;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Here's a fine house! Get at the scupper-holes"--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He bent against it as the water raced--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "And pull them out to leeward when she rolls.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They say some kinds of landsmen don't have souls.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I well believe. A Port Mahon baboon
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Would make more soul than you got with a spoon."
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Down in the icy water Dauber groped
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To find the plug; the racing water sluiced
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Over his head and shoulders as she sloped.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Without, judged by the sound, all hell was loosed.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        He felt cold Death about him tightly noosed.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That Death was better than the misery there
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Iced on the quaking foothold high in air.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And then the thought came: "I'm a failure. All
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        My life has been a failure. They were right.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        It will not matter if I go and fall;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I should be free then from this hell's delight.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I'll never paint. Best let it end to-night.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I'll slip over the side. I've tried and failed."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So in the ice-cold in the night he quailed.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        Death would be better, death, than this long hell
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of mockery and surrender and dismay--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        This long defeat of doing nothing well,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Playing the part too high for him to play.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "O Death! who hides the sorry thing away,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Take me; I've failed. I cannot play these cards."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        There came a thundering from the topsail yards.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        And then he bit his lips, clenching his mind,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And staggered out to muster, beating back
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The coward frozen self of him that whined.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Come what cards might he meant to play the pack.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Ai!" screamed the wind; the topsail sheet went clack;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Ice filled the air with spikes; the grey-backs burst.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        "Here's Dauber," said the Mate, "on deck the first.

        I took you for a soldier. Up now, come!"
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Up on the yards already they began
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That battle with a gale which strikes men dumb.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The leaping topsail thundered like a drum.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The frozen snow beat in the face like shots.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The wind spun whipping wave-crests into clots.

    </div>
    <div class="left line-block medium outermost">
      <div class="line">
        So up upon the topsail yard again,

      <div class="line">
        In the great tempest's fiercest hour, began
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Probation to the Dauber's soul, of pain
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Which crowds a century's torment in a span.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        For the next month the ocean taught this man,

        And he, in that month's torment, while she wested,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Was never warm nor dry, nor full nor rested.

      <div class="line">
        But still it blew, or, if it lulled, it rose

        Within the hour and blew again; and still
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The water as it burst aboard her froze.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The wind blew off an ice-field, raw and chill,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Daunting man's body, tampering with his will;

        But after thirty days a ghostly sun

        A great grey sea was running up the sky,

        Desolate birds flew past; their mewings came

        Its forlorn voice, its essence, its soul's name.

        The ship limped in the water as if lame.

        A slant came from the south; the singers stood

        Slowly the sea went down as the wind fell.

        Fronted the worst and looked it in the face;

        Singing he scrubbed, passing his watch below,

        Making the round-house fair; the Bosun watched,

        Chain struck his hands, ropes shot, the sky was smutched

        The fore-topgallant yard far, far aloft,

    <p class="pnext">"The Daffodil Fields" is a vivid expansion of the wonderful narrative art that John Masefield has employed with such tremendous emphasis in "The Everlasting Mercy" and in "The Story of a Round-House."</p>
    <p class="pnext">This poem-story contains the finest poetry Masefield has written and in its vigor and reserve continues to stamp him as the greatest artist of the day.</p>

    <p class="pnext">"Mr. Masefield comes like a flash of light across contemporary English poetry, and he trails glory where his imagination reveals the substances of life. The improbable has been accomplished by Mr. Masefield; he has made poetry out of the very material that has refused to yield it for almost a score of years. It has only yielded it with a passion of Keats, and shaped it with the imagination of Coleridge."--<em class="italics">Boston Evening Transcript</em>.</p>

    <p class="bold large left pfirst">Fires</p>
    <p class="bold large left pnext">By W. W. GIBSON</p>
    <p class="pnext">Author of "Daily Bread," "Womenkind," etc.</p>
    <p class="pnext"><em class="italics">Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net</em></p>
    <p class="pnext">In this striking book of verse Mr. Gibson writes of simple, homely folk with touching sympathy. The author's previous book, "Daily Bread," was heralded far and wide as the book of the year in the field of poetry; in "Fires" are contained many of the same characteristics which distinguished it. The story of a girl whose lover is struck dead by a flying bit of stone; of a wife who has unusual patience with her husband's shortcomings; of a flute player; of a shop and a shopkeeper; of a machine and those who feed it--these are the subjects of a number of the separate pieces.</p>

    <p class="bold large left pfirst">Womenkind</p>
    <p class="pnext"><em class="italics">12mo, $1.25 net</em></p>
    <p class="pnext">"There is a man in England who with sufficient plainness and sufficient profoundness is addressing himself to life, and daring to chant his own times and social circumstances, who ought to become known to America. He is bringing a message which might well rouse his day and generation to an understanding of and a sympathy with life's disinherited--the overworked masses."</p>
    <p class="pnext">"A Millet in word-painting, who writes with a terrible simplicity, is Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, born in Hexham, England, in 1878, of whom Canon Cheyne wrote: 'A new poet of the people has risen up among us--the story of a soul is written as plainly in "Daily Bread" as in "The Divine Comedy" and in "Paradise Lost."'"</p>
    <p class="pnext">"Mr. Gibson is a genuine singer of his own day, and turns into appealing harmony the world's harshly jarring notes of poverty and pain."--<em class="italics">Abridged from an article in "The Outlook."</em></p>
